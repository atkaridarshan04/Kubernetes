# **Kubernetes Ingress**

## **What is Ingress in Kubernetes?**
Ingress is a Kubernetes API object that manages external access to services in a cluster, typically HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It provides HTTP routing, SSL/TLS termination, and more, allowing services to be exposed to the outside world. Ingress is used to define how external requests should be routed to the services within the cluster.

### **Key Concepts:**
- **Ingress Controller**: A Kubernetes component that watches the Ingress resources and implements the rules specified. It listens for changes and manages routing logic for incoming traffic. Popular controllers include NGINX, Traefik, and HAProxy.
  
- **Ingress Resource**: A collection of rules that define how to route external HTTP(S) requests to services within the cluster. The Ingress resource is defined as a YAML file that specifies routing configurations and additional features (e.g., SSL/TLS termination, host-based routing).

### **Why Use Ingress?**
- **Single Entry Point**: Instead of exposing multiple services to the outside world with LoadBalancers or NodePorts, you can consolidate routing into a single endpoint.
- **Load Balancing**: Ingress can provide load balancing for incoming HTTP traffic.
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: It can handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption (HTTPS), making your services accessible securely.
- **Host and Path-based Routing**: It allows routing based on domain names (host) or URL paths.
- **Authentication and Rate Limiting**: Many Ingress controllers support authentication mechanisms, rate-limiting, and other advanced routing capabilities.

## **Ingress Components**

### **Ingress Resource**
An Ingress resource consists of:
1. **Host-based Routing**: You can route traffic based on the domain name (e.g., `myapp.example.com`).
2. **Path-based Routing**: Allows routing traffic based on the URL path (e.g., `example.com/products`).
3. **Backend Service**: The service to which the traffic should be routed.
4. **TLS/SSL Termination**: Handles HTTPS traffic by specifying SSL/TLS certificates.

#### Example of an Ingress Resource:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: demo-ingress
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints: websecure  # HTTPS
    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.tls: "true"  # Enable TLS
spec:
  rules:
    - host: myapp.example.com  # The domain or host to route traffic
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /products  # Path-based routing
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: product-service
                port:
                  number: 80
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - myapp.example.com
      secretName: myapp-tls-secret  # Secret storing the SSL certificate
```

### **Ingress Controller**
The Ingress Controller is the actual component that processes the Ingress resource and manages the routing of traffic to the services. Examples include:
- **NGINX Ingress Controller**
- **Traefik Ingress Controller**
- **HAProxy Ingress Controller**

### **Annotations**
Annotations in the Ingress resource provide additional configurations for the Ingress controller, such as:
- Enabling SSL/TLS termination
- Setting up load balancing rules
- Specifying authentication mechanisms

## **How Ingress Works**

1. **Ingress Controller**: The Ingress Controller is deployed in your cluster and watches for Ingress resources. It processes the routing rules specified in these resources.
2. **Traffic Routing**: The Ingress Controller uses the rules to route external HTTP(S) traffic to the appropriate services inside the cluster.
3. **TLS Termination**: Ingress can terminate SSL/TLS connections if configured with certificates. It decrypts incoming HTTPS traffic and forwards the unencrypted traffic to the backend services over HTTP.
4. **Path & Host-based Routing**: Ingress allows fine-grained control over routing traffic to different services based on the host (e.g., `myapp.example.com`) and path (e.g., `/products`).

## **Advanced Ingress Features**

### **SSL/TLS Termination**
Ingress can be configured to automatically terminate HTTPS traffic by using TLS certificates. The TLS certificates can be provided through Kubernetes Secrets or automatically generated using ACME (e.g., Letâ€™s Encrypt).

Example:
```yaml
tls:
  - hosts:
      - myapp.example.com
    secretName: myapp-tls-secret
```

### **Path-based Routing**
Ingress can route traffic based on URL paths, directing different requests to different services based on the URL. For example:
```yaml
rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
        - path: /products
          backend:
            service:
              name: product-service
              port:
                number: 80
```

### **Host-based Routing**
Ingress can route traffic based on the hostname. For example:
```yaml
rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
        - path: /
          backend:
            service:
              name: demo-service
              port:
                number: 80
```

### **Rate Limiting and Authentication**
Some Ingress controllers (e.g., NGINX, Traefik) support rate-limiting, basic authentication, and other advanced features through annotations.

Example (NGINX Annotations):
```yaml
annotations:
  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-connections: "1"
  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps: "5"
```

## **Ingress vs. LoadBalancer**
- **Ingress**: Provides a flexible and centralized way to route HTTP(S) traffic to services. It can be used for path and host-based routing and SSL/TLS termination.
- **LoadBalancer**: Exposes a service externally, typically on a cloud provider, but requires a LoadBalancer to be provisioned (usually expensive).
