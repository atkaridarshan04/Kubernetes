### In Kubernetes RBAC, the `apiGroups`, `resources`, and `verbs` fields are used to define access rules. Here's a detailed breakdown of the possible values for these fields:

---

### **`apiGroups`**
The `apiGroups` field specifies the API groups to which the rule applies.

- **Core API group (empty string)**: `""`
  - Includes core resources like `pods`, `services`, `configmaps`, `nodes`, etc.
- **Named API groups**:
  - `apps`: Deployment-related resources like `deployments`, `statefulsets`, and `daemonsets`.
  - `batch`: Job-related resources like `jobs` and `cronjobs`.
  - `autoscaling`: Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (`hpa`).
  - `extensions`: Deprecated group for older versions of some resources (e.g., ingress, deployments).
  - `networking.k8s.io`: Network-related resources like `networkpolicies` and `ingresses`.
  - `policy`: Pod security policies.
  - `rbac.authorization.k8s.io`: Role and binding resources.
  - `storage.k8s.io`: Storage-related resources like `storageclasses` and `volumeattachments`.

You can also use `"*"` to match all API groups.

---

### **`resources`**
The `resources` field defines the resources the rule applies to. Resources are specific to the API group.

- **Core resources (for `apiGroups: ""`)**:
  - Examples: `pods`, `services`, `endpoints`, `configmaps`, `nodes`, `persistentvolumes`, `persistentvolumeclaims`, `secrets`.
  - Subresources: Use `/` to specify subresources (e.g., `pods/log`, `pods/exec`).

- **Named API group resources**:
  - `apps`: `deployments`, `statefulsets`, `daemonsets`, `replicasets`.
  - `batch`: `jobs`, `cronjobs`.
  - `networking.k8s.io`: `ingresses`, `networkpolicies`.
  - `policy`: `poddisruptionbudgets`.
  - `rbac.authorization.k8s.io`: `roles`, `clusterroles`, `rolebindings`, `clusterrolebindings`.
  - `storage.k8s.io`: `storageclasses`, `volumeattachments`.

You can use `"*"` to match all resources within the specified `apiGroups`.

---

### **`verbs`**
The `verbs` field defines the actions the rule allows.

- Common verbs:
  - `get`: Retrieve a resource.
  - `list`: List all resources of a type.
  - `watch`: Watch resources for changes.
  - `create`: Create a resource.
  - `update`: Update an existing resource.
  - `patch`: Apply a partial update to a resource.
  - `delete`: Delete a resource.
  - `deletecollection`: Delete multiple resources at once.
  - `proxy`: Proxy requests to a resource.
  - `use`: Special verb for certain resources like `podsecuritypolicies`.

You can use `"*"` to match all verbs.

### Example Rule
Hereâ€™s an example with specific values for these fields:

```yaml
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["apps", "batch"]
    resources: ["deployments", "jobs"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```
