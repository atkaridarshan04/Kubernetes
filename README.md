## **Folder Structure**  

### **[Cluster-Setups](./Cluster-Setups)**  
Contains examples for setting up Kubernetes clusters using tools like:  
- **Minikube**  
- **Kubeadm**  
- **Kind**  

Includes detailed configuration files, setup instructions, and common commands to get your cluster running efficiently.

### **[Deployment-Strategies](./Deployment-Strategies)**  
Explains various deployment strategies in Kubernetes, such as:  
- **Rolling Updates**: Gradually update pods without downtime.  
- **Canary Deployments**: Release updates to a small subset of users for testing.  
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Switch between old and new versions instantly for minimal disruption.  

---  

### **[Ingress](./Ingress)**  
Example for setting up and configuring **Ingress resources** to manage external access to services within the cluster.  
- Routing HTTP/S traffic to services.  
- Setting up **TLS certificates** for secure communication.  
- Using **Traefik** as the Ingress controller for advanced traffic management.  

---  

### **[Network-Policy](./Network-Policy)**  
Provides examples and use cases for implementing Kubernetes **Network Policies**:  
- Restricting pod-to-pod communication.  
- Securing inter-namespace traffic.  
- Configuring policies for ingress and egress traffic.

### **[pv_&_pvs](./pv_&_pvs)**  
Covers **Persistent Volumes (PV)** and **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**:  
- Explains the difference between static and dynamic provisioning.  
- Demonstrates how to persist data for stateful applications.  
- Includes examples to integrate PVs and PVCs with your Kubernetes deployments.  

---  

### **[RBAC](./RBAC)**  
Demonstrates the use of **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to secure Kubernetes clusters:  
- Setting up roles and role bindings.  
- Assigning permissions to users and service accounts.  
- Managing access to resources with fine-grained control.
